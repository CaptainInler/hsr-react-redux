# 2. Redux Counter

## Run

```sh
npm install && npm start
```

## Todo

1. Why does the `Counter />` component not extend `React.Component`?

2. Render a second `<Counter />` component

3. Clicking on the second `<Counter />` component should increment by +2 instead of +1

> Note: there are multiple ways to accomplish this: via a payload on the action or via a separate action
